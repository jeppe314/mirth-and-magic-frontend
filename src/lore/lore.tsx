    <p>Through the dense forests of the North, a figure treaded.</p>
    <p>
      Days blurred as the wanderer's boots crunched over leaves and snow. The wind whispered of ancient spirits, but the
      traveler pressed on.
    </p>
    <p>As the sun set, a city's silhouette appeared between peaks, its spires promising shelter and a fresh start...</p>

    <p>- Borgulf, are my eyes deceiving me or do you also see a single walker in the distance?</p>
    <p>- I see him, Bjorn.</p>
    <p>- An adventurer, surely. No common folk would travel the deep forests alone. Albeit in this weather.</p>
    <p>
      - Alas, he would not be the first. Bjorn, what is he? The glaring sun impairs my vision and I cannot determine his
      race.

      The traveler's pace quickened as he approached the gates of the city, his silhouette becoming clearer with each
      step. The setting sun cast long shadows, painting a dramatic scene as the wanderer neared the two guards.

      - By Odin's beard, he's closer now. Look at the determination in his eyes, Borgulf. This one has seen things,
      experienced the world beyond these walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Aye, Bjorn. And yet, there's a hint of weariness. The forests are not kind to lone travelers. He must have tales
      to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the traveler reached the gates, he paused, taking a moment to catch his breath and survey the city before him.
      Borgulf stepped forward, his voice firm yet welcoming.

    <p>- Hail, traveler! What brings you to our city after such a perilous journey through the wilds?</p>
    <p>
      The wanderer looked up, his eyes meeting Borgulf's. There was a brief silence, the weight of countless stories and
      adventures hanging in the air.
    </p>
    <p>- Many tales, many roads, and now, this city. I seek refuge and perhaps a new beginning.</p>
    <p>Bjorn, ever curious, chimed in with a friendly grin.</p>
    <p>- Before you enter, might we have the honor of knowing your name, traveler?</p>
